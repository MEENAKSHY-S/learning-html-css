    <!-- paragraph 1 -->

    <p class="para">Mental health includes our emotional, psychological, and social well-being. It affects how we think, feel, and act. 
        It also helps determine how we handle stress, relate to others, and make healthy choices. Mental health is important 
        at every stage of life, from childhood and adolescence through adulthood.Mental and physical health are equally important 
        components of overall health.  For example, depression increases the risk for many types of physical health problems, 
        particularly long-lasting conditions like diabetes, heart disease, and stroke. Similarly, the presence of chronic conditions 
        can increase the risk for mental illness. </p>
        
        <!-- paragraph 2 -->
    <p class="para"> It's important to remember that a person's mental health can change over time, depending on many factors.  When the demands 
        placed on a person exceed their resources and coping abilities, their mental health could be impacted. For example, if someone 
        is working long hours, caring for a relative, or experiencing economic hardship, they may experience poor mental health.</p>
